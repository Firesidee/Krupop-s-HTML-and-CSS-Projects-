                    <p>
                        Domestic Chickens (Gallus domesticus) have been around for thousands of years <br>
                        and are descendants of are descendants of Red Junglefowl (Gallus gallus).  They've<br>
                        served many purposes, from supplying food with their meat and eggs, to aiding fishermen<br>
                        who use their feathers to make fly ties.  Many hobbyists also enjoy breeding for certain<br>
                        qualities and competing with others in poultry shows.<br></p>
                        <p>
                        The earliest indications of domestic
                        chickens existing are skeletal remains found in China,<br>
                        dated back to 5400 B.C.  As it so happens, Marco Polo was the first to record "Chickens with<br> fur instead of feathers" (Silkies)<br>

                    <h1>Common Breeds</h1>
                    <p>There are literally hundreds of modern domestic chickens breeds, so to save <br>
                        you the headache of looking through each breed, trying to decide what breed might<br>
                        be best for you, I've listed a few of the most common breeds along with their facts<br>
                        below.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Easter Egger</h3>
                    <h4>Hen</h4>
                            <img src="./Images/Thumbnails/Easter_Egger_Hen1.jfif" width="400" height="400" alt="Image not found">
                    <h4>Rooster</h4>
                            <img src="./Images/Thumbnails/Easter_Egger_Rooster1.jfif" width="400" height="300" alt="Image not found">
                    <h4>Eggs</h4>
                            <img src="./Images/Thumbnails/Easter_Egger_Eggs.jfif" width="400" height="400" alt="Image not found">
                    <h4>Chicks</h4>
                            <img src="./Images/Thumbnails/Easter_Egger_Chicks.jfif" width="500" height="300" alt="Image not found">
                    <p>The Easter Egger is not an official breed, seeing as they have no breed standard.  However, they are<br> 
                        very popular, mainly due to the fact that the hens lay blue or green eggs and that they can be bought at<br>
                        a much cheaper price than their recognized breed descendants, the Ameraucana.</p>
                        <p> Even though these guys are not a breed, it does not mean they should be passed by.<br>
                            The hens are very sweet an gentle, easily tameable, and, like most chickens, will begin<br>
                            to lay eggs at around six months of age.
                        </p>
                        <p>Fun Fact: Due to the fact that Easter Eggers were used to create Ameraucanas, and <br>
                        Ameraucanas are more desirable by breeders/show hobbyists, a lot of feed stores will sell<br>
                        Easter Egger chicks labeled as Ameraucanas to unsuspecting customers.  The best way to avoid<br>
                        this is to buy chicks from honest breeders, or to look closely at how the store spells Ameraucana,<br>
                        as most will misspell it, instead writing something like "Americana" on the bin breed tag. </p>

                    <h4>Hen</h4>

                        <p>The Buff Orpington is a breed of chicken that is very calm and great with beginners, while are popular<br>
                            among egg enthusiasts due to the fact that they boast many feathers for a very fluffy appearance and feel,<br>
                            as well as the fact that hens lay a light brown egg.  This breed is also popular among show hobbyists, with<br>
                            show birds having a more rounded appearance than hatchery birds.</p>
                            <p>Fun Fact: The "Buff" Orpington isn't a breed in and of itself.  Buff is the variety, (color)<br>
                            Orpington is the breed.  Orpingtons can come in several varieties such as Lavender, Jubilee<br>
                            and White.</p>

                        <p>Once again, these birds are not actually a breed, but nevertheless remain popular among egg hobbyists and<br>
                            people who cannot own roosters due to zoning laws.  They are a cross-breed between a barred hen and a black<br>
                            rooster of any breed.  All hatchery/feed store chicks will lay brown eggs, but can lay blue/green eggs if a<br>
                            breeder puts a black Ameraucana rooster over a barred or cuckoo hen since the blue egg gene is dominant over<br>
                            white or brown egg genes.  This is a great beginner bird.</p>
                            <p> Fun fact: Due to the fact that barred/cuckoo hens can only produce barred roosters and black hens when bred to a black<br>
                        rooster, the chicks can be sexed at hatching, resulting in providing the buyer with no risk of an accidental rooster<br>
                            in a hen only environment.<br></p>

                        <h1>Sexing</h1>
                        <p>
                            Sexing is relatively easy, especially once you get the hang of it.  You may hear of a thing called "Feather<br>
                        Sexing" don't rely on it.  It only works with chicks that have fast growing feathers and is not very accurate.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Unless the chick is a sex-at-hatch breed (Black Sex-link, Bielefelder, Red/Gold Sex-link, Crested Cream Legbar)<br>
                        chicks cannot be effecientally sexed until 4-6 weeks of age unless the breed is a difficult to sex one, such as<br>
                        a silkie.  Those cannot be effecientally sexed until 8-12 weeks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The most effective way for sexing chicks at this age is to look at the comb, most pullets will have a small yellow<br>
                            or pink comb, while a cockeral will have a larger red comb with waddles already beginning to develop.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Pullet</h4>

                    <p>
                        If you are sexing young ones that are 12 weeks or older, you can use the saddle feather method.  Saddle feathers are the<br>
                        feathers that grow down the chicken's back and hang down just in front of the tail.
                        This is a very reliable sexing method, really the only way<br>
                        it can fail is if you are dealing with silkies or a breed with "hennie" feathering.  Hennie feathering is a gene that causes<br>
                        roosters to display hen-like saddle feathers for their entire lives. (Silver Sebrights)  Normally, roosters will have long, slender,<br>
                        pointy saddle feathers and hens will have short, wide, and round saddle feathers.
